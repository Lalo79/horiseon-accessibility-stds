        b. Main Image <Section class="hero">
        c. Main Content <Main>
        d. Side Bar <Aside>
        e. Footer <Footer>

    - Eliminated redundant classes in Sections in Main content. All sections were set as "section-main"

    - Eliminated independent classes in <div> and defined a single class "benefit"

    - Added Alternative Captions to Images in both sections <maion> and <aside>

* Modifications in CSS file
    - With the consolidation of clases in HTML, several CSS styles could be eliminated given that they had the same content and tehy could be agrouped in tags and a couple of classes.

    - CSS styles groups were reorganized so they folloed the same flow as the HTML file and the same order in which elements are nested.
